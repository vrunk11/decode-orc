# Preview Window

## Overview

The Preview Window displays the video output of the currently active pipeline
stage. It provides frame-by-frame navigation, channel selection, dropout
visualisation, and a suite of signal-analysis tools: Line Scope, Frame Timing,
Waveform Monitor, Vectorscope, and several metadata observers.

## Navigation Bar

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| << | Jump to the first frame or field. |
| < | Step back one frame or field. Hold to step continuously. |
| ▶ / ⏸ | Play back at the project frame rate (PAL: 25 fps; NTSC: ~30 fps). Press again to pause. Stops automatically at the last frame. |
| > | Step forward one frame or field. Hold to step continuously. |
| >> | Jump to the last frame or field. |
| Frame spinbox | Type a frame number to jump there directly (1-indexed display). |
| Slider | Drag to scrub through the entire range. Rendering is debounced during rapid movement. |

## Control Row

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Preview Mode | Select the output type: **Frame**, **Top Field**, **Bottom Field**, or other modes offered by the selected stage. |
| Channel | For YC (separate luma/chroma) sources: **Y+C** (composite display), **Luma (Y)**, or **Chroma (C)**. Hidden for composite CVBS sources. |
| Aspect Ratio | Set the display aspect ratio: Square Pixels, 4:3, 16:9, and others. |
| Zoom 1:1 | Resize the preview window so the image is displayed at its native pixel resolution. |
| Dropouts: Off/On | Toggle the dropout overlay. When enabled, samples flagged as dropout are highlighted in red over the preview image. |

## Line Scope

Click anywhere in the preview image to open the **Line Scope**, which shows the
raw sample waveform for that horizontal line.

- Horizontal axis: sample position across the line.
- Vertical axis: signal amplitude in millivolts.
- For YC sources, separate **Y** (luma) and **C** (chroma) waveforms are shown.
- Black level and white level markers are drawn from active video parameter hints.
- Up/Down navigation controls step to adjacent lines without closing the scope.
- A cross-hair on the preview image tracks the sample marker position in the
  scope and vice versa.

## File Menu

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Export PNG... | Ctrl+Shift+E | Save the currently displayed preview image as a PNG file. |

## Observers Menu

Observers decode metadata from the video signal and display it in floating
dialogs that update as you navigate frames.

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| VBI Decoder | Ctrl+Shift+V | Decode Vertical Blanking Interval data: closed captions, VITC timecode, teletext, and LaserDisc programme metadata. |
| Quality Metrics | Ctrl+Shift+M | Per-frame signal quality statistics: SNR, colour burst level, and dropout sample count. |
| NTSC Observer | Ctrl+Shift+N | NTSC-specific frame metadata: FM code status and white flag bit. |

## Hints Menu

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Video Parameter Hints | Ctrl+Shift+H | Show the video parameters in effect for the selected stage: colour system (PAL/NTSC), line count, black level, white level, and active video geometry. User overrides are flagged separately from signal-derived values. |

## View Menu

Signal analysis tools displayed as waveform or vector graphs in floating dialogs.

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Frame Timing | Ctrl+Shift+T | Show the sync and timing waveform across all lines of the current frame. Useful for diagnosing sync pulse position and line structure. |
| Waveform Monitor | Ctrl+Shift+W | Sample histogram across multiple lines with adjustable gain and range. Available for supported stages only. |
| Vectorscope | Ctrl+Shift+S | U/V chroma vector plot with a standard vectorscope graticule. Available for stages with separate Y and C channels. |

### Waveform Monitor

Displays a stacked histogram of sample values across a range of lines.

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Gain | Vertical amplification of the trace. |
| Range | The vertical display range in millivolts. |

Only available when the selected stage provides this view.

### Vectorscope

Plots the chroma U and V components as a scatter on a standard vectorscope graticule.

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Field | Choose which field (top, bottom, or full frame) contributes to the plot. |
| Blend | Persistence factor — higher values retain more signal history on screen. |
| Defocus | Gaussian blur on the trace to aid reading at high dot density. |

Only available for stages that output separate Y and C channels.

### VBI Decoder

Decodes and displays Vertical Blanking Interval content for the current frame,
including closed captions, VITC timecode, teletext lines, and LaserDisc
programme metadata such as chapter and frame numbers.

### Quality Metrics

Per-frame signal quality data:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SNR | Signal-to-noise ratio of the luma channel. |
| Burst Level | Amplitude of the colour burst reference signal. |
| Dropout Count | Number of dropout samples detected in this frame. |

### NTSC Observer

Shows NTSC-specific frame metadata including the FM code status and white flag bit.

### Video Parameter Hints

Shows the video parameters currently in effect for the selected stage: colour
system (PAL/NTSC), nominal line count, black level, white level, first and last
active frame lines, and whether each value originates from the source signal or
a user override applied by the Video Parameters stage.
