// reference-counted. References are held by (a) this loader's handle entry,
// (b) every registered stage factory, and (c) every live stage instance
// created by such a factory. unload_all() releases only (a); the shared
// library is actually closed when the last factory copy and stage instance
// are destroyed. Consequently stage objects remain valid — vtables included —
// even if the loader is cleared first.
//
// Thread safety: load_plugin() and unload_all() are not thread-safe and are
// expected to run on a single thread (plugin loading happens once at
// startup). Stage factories and stage instances may be used and released on
// any thread afterwards.
