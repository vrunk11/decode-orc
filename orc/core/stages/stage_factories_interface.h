     * The reason we need this separate factory for stages (instead of shoving everything into IFactories) is that the stages are created somewhat dynamically and are like plugins.
     * Therefore, each stage should know about its dependencies with the parent 'core' being intentionally ignorant, to promote encapsulation.
     *
     * We could take this a step further and have separate factories for each stage, but that introduces a lot of boilerplate.
     * We could also just shove everything into IFactories which introduces a lot of bloat in one interface.
     *
     * Having a separate factory for all stages is a decent compromise.
