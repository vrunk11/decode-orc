 *
 * All hint structs should include these fields to maintain consistency
 * and allow generic hint processing.

 * We use a convention-based approach rather than inheritance to keep
 * hints as simple POD-like structs. Each hint type should include:
 *
 *   HintSource source = HintSource::METADATA;
 *   int confidence_pct = 0;  // 0-100
 *
 * This allows hints to be easily serialized, copied, and used in
 * constexpr contexts while maintaining a consistent interface.
