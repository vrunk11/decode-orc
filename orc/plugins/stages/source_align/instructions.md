# Source Align

Synchronises between 1 and 16 input sources so that output field 0 corresponds to the same physical disc position across all inputs. Without alignment, independent captures may start at different tracks, making pixel-level stacking impossible. Source Align solves this by detecting the first common field and discarding the leading fields that precede it in each source.

## When to use

Use Source Align whenever you connect more than one source to a Stacker stage and the captures did not start at exactly the same disc position. Example: three captures of the same LaserDisc that each began playing slightly earlier or later — connect all three to Source Align before Stacker. The stage report generated after execution shows the per-input offsets that were applied.

## What it does

For CAV discs the stage reads the VBI frame number embedded in each field's vertical-blanking interval and finds the highest first-frame number across all inputs. Fields before that frame number are dropped from every input. For CLV discs the equivalent CLV timecode frame value is used. If `alignmentMap` is set, the automatic detection is skipped and the specified per-input offsets are applied directly. Each aligned input produces one output; the outputs are guaranteed to be frame-aligned with one another.

Audio follows the alignment. Every audio channel pair remaps per frame: trimmed sources serve their audio from the shifted frame IDs, and padded sources carry silence on the prepended padding frames. Each output frame always carries the exact per-frame sample count required by its position in the output timeline (constant on PAL; alternating per the SMPTE 272M five-frame sequence on NTSC/PAL-M), so an offset that breaks the NTSC/PAL-M sequence phase trims or silence-pads each shifted frame's audio by a single trailing stereo pair. Offsets that preserve the phase (multiples of 5) — and all PAL offsets — are sample-exact. Sample values and rates are never changed.

## Parameters

### alignmentMap (string)
Manual alignment override. Format: `INPUT_ID+OFFSET` entries separated by commas, where INPUT_ID is the 1-based input number and OFFSET is the number of fields to drop from that input. Example: `1+2, 2+2, 3+1, 4+1`. Default: `""` (auto-detect from VBI frame numbers or CLV timecodes).

## Tools

### Source Alignment Analysis
Analyses all connected sources and determines the optimal per-input offset so that every source starts at the same disc position. Choose an alignment mode: `pad_for_alignment` prepends synthetic padding frames so all sources start from the earliest VBI frame available across all inputs (no frames are lost); `first_common_frame` trims all sources to the first VBI frame that exists in every input (may discard unique leading content). The tool writes the resulting offset map to `alignmentMap` automatically. The analysis can be cancelled at any time from the tool dialog. Available for LaserDisc sources only. Invoke from the Stage Tools menu.

## Status Indicator

The coloured dot in the top-right corner of the node shows its configuration status.

| Colour | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Green | Fully configured and ready to run. All required parameters are set. |
| Yellow | Partially configured. The stage can run but will use default or reduced behaviour — for example, pass-through mode or console-only output. Review the parameters for optional settings. |
| Red | Not configured. One or more required parameters are missing and the stage cannot run. |

Parameters can be set via **Edit Parameters...** in the node context menu. Some stages also provide interactive stage tools (listed under **Tools** above) that set parameters directly from within the tool.
