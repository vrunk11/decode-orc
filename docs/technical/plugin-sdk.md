# Plugin SDK Developer Guide

This guide covers everything needed to create, build, test, and distribute a
third-party Decode-Orc stage plugin using the public Plugin SDK. No changes to
the Decode-Orc source repository are required.

## Quick Start

First install the SDK package from a decode-orc checkout (see
[Obtaining the SDK](#obtaining-the-sdk) below), then build a plugin against
it. The smallest complete, in-repo example is the CI fixture plugin at
`orc-tests/fixtures/external-stage-plugin/` — three files (CMakeLists.txt,
plugin.cpp, one stage header) that configure, build, and load exactly as an
external plugin:

```bash
cmake -S my-orc-plugin -B my-orc-plugin/build \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/sdk-prefix
cmake --build my-orc-plugin/build -j
```

Alternatively, clone the official skeleton template for a scaffold with unit
tests and CI workflows (note: the skeleton repository may lag the SDK — the
in-repo fixture above is always in sync with the installed package):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simoninns/orc-plugin_skeleton my-orc-plugin
```

## SDK Headers

Most plugin code needs only the public SDK umbrella header:

```cpp
#include <orc/abi/orc_plugin_sdk.h>
```

(The pre-tier spelling `<orc/plugin/orc_plugin_sdk.h>` still works via a
deprecated forwarding shim — see *Deprecated pre-tier include paths* below.)

### Tier model

The SDK surface is split into three tiers with distinct stability promises:

- **`orc/abi/`** — the frozen binary contract: descriptor, entrypoints,
  registration, and service tables. Any change here bumps the host ABI
  version. (The `orc/plugin/` plugin-API headers are treated as part of this
  ABI surface until they are relocated under a tier.)
- **`orc/stage/`** — the stage contract: interfaces and data types that cross
  the plugin boundary, grouped by **domain** (`preview/`, `observation/`,
  `dropout/`, `audio/`, `params/`) with the foundation types at the tier root.
  A layout change here bumps the host ABI.
- **`orc/support/`** — compiled-into-plugin utilities. Explicitly **not** ABI:
  changes never require a bump, only a plugin recompile at the author's
  leisure.

The complete tiered header surface is generated from the single-source
manifest `orc/sdk/sdk_headers.yaml`:

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED SDK HEADER TABLES (source: orc/sdk/sdk_headers.yaml; regenerate with tools/gen_sdk_header_docs.sh) -->

#### `orc/abi/` — frozen binary contract

Stability: **any change bumps the host ABI version.** Descriptor,
entrypoints, registration, and service tables.

#### Deprecated pre-tier include paths

The 27 flat `<orc/plugin/...>` / `<orc/stage/...>` paths that
predate this layout are retained as forwarding shims for one release, gated
by the `ORC_SDK_DEPRECATED_INCLUDE_SHIMS` CMake option (default ON). New
code must use the tiered paths above; building with the option OFF turns any
remaining pre-tier include into a hard compile error.

<!-- END GENERATED SDK HEADER TABLES -->

The manifest is also the source of the enforced include allowlist
(`cmake/sdk_header_allowlist.txt`, generated by
`tools/gen_sdk_header_allowlist.sh`): the gate script
(`cmake/check_plugin_private_includes.sh`) fails the build on any plugin
include outside it, other than plugin-local headers, standard-library and
platform headers, and permitted third-party headers (`fmt`/`spdlog`
unconditionally; other libraries when declared by the plugin's own CMake
target).

### Design Notes on the Allowlist

A few allowlist entries carry rationale worth knowing:

- **Logging surface.** In-tree plugins use the `ORC_LOG_*` macro family from
  the support-tier header `<orc/support/logging.h>`, backed by the host's
  spdlog logger. Out-of-tree plugins should prefer the services-table macros
  (`ORC_PLUGIN_LOG_*` from `<orc/plugin/orc_plugin_services_helpers.h>`) to
  avoid a direct spdlog dependency. The application logging header
  `orc/common/include/logging.h` (`get_app_logger()`) is unrelated and is the
  GUI/CLI surface only; the contract header lives at `<orc/support/logging.h>`
  precisely so the two can never be confused via include-path order.
- **Observer classes were removed (ABI 10).** The concrete
  `<orc/stage/observation/*_observer.h>` classes and the `Observer` base
  (`<orc/stage/observation/observer.h>`), deprecated in ABI 9, are removed from
  the SDK as of ABI 10: they are host-internal and no longer shipped in
  `orc-sdk-support`. Obtain observations through the host-owned
  [`IObservationService`](#observation-service-abi-9), selecting observers by
  stable id. (The remaining `<orc/stage/observation/...>` entries —
  `observation_context*.h`, `observation_schema.h`, and
  `observation_service_interface.h` — stay part of the contract.)
- **`lru_cache.h`** is a self-contained generic container with no host
  coupling, allowlisted because several plugins legitimately use it for frame
  caching — preferable to each plugin vendoring a copy.

### Stability Guarantees

Headers in the public SDK carry an explicit stability commitment:
- Changes to ABI-level contracts require a bump to `kStagePluginHostAbiVersion`.
- Changes to stage API contracts require a bump to `kStagePluginApiVersion`.
- Incompatible plugins are refused by the host with a diagnostic message;
  they are never silently mis-loaded.

## What Plugins Must Not Include

The SDK boundary is an **allowlist**: anything not listed in the SDK Headers
section above (or covered by the plugin-local / standard-library /
third-party allowances) is private and will change without notice. Typical
private surfaces plugins must never reach into:

| Forbidden header path | Reason |
|-----------------------|--------|
| `orc/core/include/*.h` | Internal host implementation headers (e.g. `dag_executor.h`, `preview_renderer.h`, `stage_registry.h`, `buffered_file_io.h`) |
| `orc/core/analysis/*.h`, `orc/core/observers/*.h` | Host analysis/observer internals (the observer headers plugins may use live under `<orc/stage/observation/...>`) |
| `orc/presenters/*.h` | Presenter layer — GUI/CLI internal |
| `orc/gui/*.h` | GUI internal |
| `orc/cli/*.h` | CLI internal |

The boundary is enforced twice:

1. **At compile time** — the `orc::plugin-sdk` target exposes only the SDK
   include tree (plus spdlog/fmt) and the `orc::orc-sdk-support` static library
   (support-tier helper symbols). It does **not** link the host, so a plugin
   translation unit that includes a private host header fails to compile.
2. **By the allowlist scan** — `check_plugin_private_includes.sh` (a hard CI
   gate, `ctest -L sdk`) fails on any include outside the allowlist even if
   it would compile.

Do not link directly against `orc-core`, `orc-presenters`, `orc-gui`, or
`orc-cli`. Link only against `orc::plugin-sdk`. Third-party libraries a
plugin needs (FFmpeg, SQLite, FFTW, ...) must be declared by the plugin's
own CMake target — they are no longer inherited from the host.

If a capability you need is missing from the SDK, open an issue in the
decode-orc repository. Missing capability is never a reason to include private
headers or link private internals.

## CMake Integration

### Obtaining the SDK

The SDK is installed as part of a decode-orc install tree. From a decode-orc
checkout:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/sdk-prefix
```

The prefix then contains the CMake package
(`lib/cmake/decode-orc-plugin-sdk/`), the public SDK headers
(`include/decode-orc-plugin-sdk/`), the `orc-sdk-support` static library
(`lib/liborc-sdk-support.a`), and the `orc-cli`/`orc-gui` binaries used to load
and test your plugin. Plugins link the SDK alone — the host libraries
(`orc-core`, `orc-common`) are not part of the SDK package.

CI also publishes the SDK on its own as
`decode-orc-plugin-sdk-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz` (headers + static library +
CMake config + enforcement scripts). Unpack it anywhere and point
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at the unpacked directory — no decode-orc source tree or its
FFmpeg / yaml-cpp / PNG / SQLite3 dependency stack is required, only spdlog and
fmt. `FetchContent_Declare(... URL <tarball>)` works the same way.

### Out-of-tree plugin project

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
project(my-orc-stage VERSION 1.0.0 LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(decode-orc-plugin-sdk REQUIRED)

orc_add_stage_plugin(
    my-orc-stage-my-filter
    OUTPUT_NAME    orc-plugin_my-filter_my-stage
    PLUGIN_VERSION "${PROJECT_VERSION}"
    SOURCES        plugin.cpp my_filter_stage.cpp
)
```

Configure with the SDK prefix on `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/sdk-prefix
cmake --build build -j
```

The built plugin lands in `<build-dir>/lib/orc-stage-plugins/`. Load it into
the host with the plugin search path environment variable:

```bash
ORC_STAGE_PLUGIN_PATHS=<build-dir>/lib/orc-stage-plugins orc-cli plugins list
```

The installed `decode-orc-plugin-sdk` CMake package provides:
- `orc::plugin-sdk` — imported INTERFACE target with the SDK include paths,
  spdlog/fmt, and the `orc::orc-sdk-support` static library (support-tier
  helper symbols). No host library is linked
- `orc::orc-sdk-support` — the support-tier helper static library, pulled in
  transitively by `orc::plugin-sdk`
- `orc_add_stage_plugin()` — plugin target helper macro
- The public SDK headers (`<orc/abi/...>`, `<orc/stage/...>`, `<orc/support/...>`)
- `check_plugin_private_includes.sh` / `check_plugin_private_links.sh` — SDK enforcement gate scripts

The package's only `find_dependency` requirements are **spdlog** and **fmt**.

This exact flow is validated in decode-orc CI on every push: the fixture
plugin `orc-tests/fixtures/external-stage-plugin/` is built against a
freshly installed prefix and loaded into the installed `orc-cli`.

### Validating SDK-only compliance locally

To run the same enforcement gates that execute in Decode-Orc CI/CD, use the
scripts bundled with the installed SDK package (located at
`<install-prefix>/lib/cmake/decode-orc-plugin-sdk/`):

```bash
# Check every include in your plugin tree against the SDK allowlist
bash <sdk-install>/check_plugin_private_includes.sh /path/to/your-plugin-repo

# Check for forbidden private-link dependencies in your plugin target
bash <sdk-install>/check_plugin_private_links.sh /path/to/your-plugin-repo
```

When pointed at a tree that is not a decode-orc checkout, both scripts run in
standalone mode: the whole tree is scanned as a single plugin (includes may
resolve anywhere within it). Both scripts exit with code 1 and print a
diagnostic on violations. Run them before opening a pull request or tagging a
release.

### Output naming

Follow the artifact naming convention so the host can validate and cache
plugin binaries correctly:

```
orc-plugin_<stage-name>_<platform>.<ext>
```

## Implementing a Stage

### Minimal plugin structure

The registration helpers in `<orc/abi/orc_plugin_registration.h>` (pulled
in by the umbrella header) expand the entire plugin boilerplate — descriptor
version/toolchain fields, both entrypoints, service-table storage, and stage
registration — from two statements:

```cpp
#include <orc/abi/orc_plugin_sdk.h>

#include "my_stage.h"  // Your DAGStage subclass

namespace {

// The ABI version, API version, and toolchain tag are filled in from the SDK
// the plugin is compiled against. All pointer fields point to static storage.
constexpr orc::StagePluginDescriptor kDescriptor =
    ORC_STAGE_PLUGIN_DESCRIPTOR("com.example.stage.my-filter",  // plugin_id
                                "1.0.0",  // plugin_version
                                "MIT",    // license_spdx
                                false);   // is_core_plugin

}  // namespace

// Expands to both required entrypoints. MyStage is registered under the
// stage name reported by its own get_node_type_info().stage_name — the stage
// class is the single source of truth for registration metadata. List
// additional stage types as further arguments to register several stages
// from one plugin.
ORC_DEFINE_STAGE_PLUGIN(kDescriptor, MyStage)
```

Stage types passed to `ORC_DEFINE_STAGE_PLUGIN` must be either
default-constructible or constructible from `orc::IStageServices*`; in the
latter case the host's consolidated stage services are injected automatically
when the stage is created.

The same pattern is used by every bundled stage plugin — see
`orc/plugins/stages/mask_line/plugin.cpp` (single stage) or
`orc/plugins/stages/cvbs_source/plugin.cpp` (multiple stages) in the
Decode-Orc repository for complete real-world examples.

### Raw entrypoints (custom registration logic)

Plugins that need custom registration logic — stages with other constructor
signatures, conditional registration, dynamic stage sets — can write the two
exported entrypoints by hand instead:

```cpp
#include <orc/abi/orc_plugin_sdk.h>

#include "my_stage.h"

namespace {

// Factory the host calls to create stage instances on demand.
// Must match orc::OrcStageFactoryFn: std::shared_ptr<DAGStage> (*)().
orc::DAGStagePtr create_my_stage() { return std::make_shared<MyStage>(); }

// Plugin descriptor. Fields are positional and must follow the declaration
// order in <orc/abi/orc_plugin_abi.h>. All pointer fields must point to
// static storage.
constexpr orc::StagePluginDescriptor kDescriptor{
    "com.example.stage.my-filter",    // plugin_id
    "1.0.0",                          // plugin_version
    orc::kStagePluginHostAbiVersion,  // host_abi_version
    orc::kStagePluginApiVersion,      // plugin_api_version
    "MIT",                            // license_spdx
    false,                            // is_core_plugin
    ORC_SDK_TOOLCHAIN_TAG,            // toolchain_tag
};

}  // namespace

ORC_STAGE_PLUGIN_EXPORT const orc::StagePluginDescriptor*
orc_get_stage_plugin_descriptor() {
  return &kDescriptor;
}

ORC_STAGE_PLUGIN_EXPORT bool orc_register_stage_plugin(
    const orc::OrcPluginServices* services, void* context,
    bool (*register_stage)(void* context, const char* stage_name,
                           orc::OrcStageFactoryFn factory),
    const char** error_message) {
  // Store the host service table before registering any stage; the pointer
  // remains valid for the lifetime of the loaded plugin.
  orc::plugin::set_services(services);

  if (!register_stage) {
    if (error_message) {
      *error_message = "Missing stage registration callback";
    }
    return false;
  }

  if (!register_stage(context, "my_filter", &create_my_stage)) {
    if (error_message) {
      *error_message = "Host rejected stage registration";
    }
    return false;
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Stage interfaces

Implement one or more of these interfaces depending on stage behaviour:

| Interface | Use when |
|-----------|----------|
| `DAGStage` | Base interface — all stages |
| `ParameterizedStage` | Stage exposes user-configurable parameters |
| `TriggerableStage` | Stage responds to external trigger events |

### Receiving data

Override `DAGStage::execute()` to receive `ArtifactPtr` inputs from upstream
nodes. Return a vector of `ArtifactPtr` outputs to pass downstream.

### Transform stages: VideoFrameRepresentationWrapper contract

Transform stages that expose video output extend
`VideoFrameRepresentationWrapper` (in
`<orc/stage/video_frame_representation.h>`). The wrapper's public read API
**always describes the stage's output**: downstream stages, observers, and
analysis sinks can never reach unprocessed upstream data through any
accessor, and stages themselves may only read from the wrapped input
(`source_`), never from anything further upstream.

The accessors fall into two groups:

- **Pass-through primitives** (forwarded to the wrapped input): navigation
  (`frame_range`, `frame_count`, `has_frame`, `get_frame_descriptor`),
  `get_frame`, `has_separate_channels`, `get_frame_luma`,
  `get_frame_chroma`, `get_dropout_hints`, `get_video_parameters`, and the
  audio / EFM / AC3 accessors. A stage whose output differs from its input
  for one of these **must** override it. A stage that remaps frame IDs must
  override every per-frame accessor in this group so IDs are translated —
  for audio that means `get_audio_samples` (per channel pair): the output
  frame at timeline index *p* must serve exactly `audio_pairs_in_frame(p)`
  pairs, truncating or silence-padding by one pair when the mapping breaks
  the NTSC/PAL-M cadence phase (see `<orc/stage/audio/audio_channel_pair.h>`).
- **Derived accessors** (`get_line`, `get_line_samples`, `get_frame_copy`,
  `get_line_luma`, `get_line_chroma`): implemented by the wrapper in terms
  of the object's own virtual primitives, never forwarded. Overriding the
  frame-level primitives is therefore sufficient for correctness on every
  read path; overriding a derived accessor is purely an optimisation (for
  example, a stage that does not modify sample data may forward line reads
  to the wrapped input to preserve a source's seek-one-line-from-disk fast
  path).

This contract is verified by
`orc-tests/core/unit/contracts/video_frame_representation_wrapper_contract_test.cpp`.

### Parameters

`ParameterizedStage` exposes three methods:

- `get_parameter_descriptors(VideoSystem, SourceType)` — returns the list of
  `ParameterDescriptor` records this stage supports, filtered by the project's
  video format and source type (a no-argument convenience overload passes
  `Unknown` for both).
- `get_parameters()` — returns the current values as a
  `std::map<std::string, ParameterValue>`.
- `set_parameters(const std::map<std::string, ParameterValue>&)` — applies new
  values; returns `true` if all parameters were valid and set successfully.

`ParameterValue` is a `std::variant` holding one of: `int32_t`, `uint32_t`,
`double`, `bool`, or `std::string`. The corresponding `ParameterType` enum
additionally distinguishes `FILE_PATH` (a string for which the GUI shows a
file browser).

### Configuration status

Stages can report their readiness to the host UI via `set_configuration_status()`,
which accepts a value from the `orc::ConfigurationStatus` enum:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ConfigurationStatus::Green` | Fully configured or requires no parameters |
| `ConfigurationStatus::Yellow` | Partially configured; some parameters are missing or empty |
| `ConfigurationStatus::Red` | Unconfigured; critical required parameters are absent |

The host renders a small coloured dot on the stage node in the pipeline graph to
give the user at-a-glance feedback.

**When to call `set_configuration_status()`:**

- In the constructor — set `Yellow` if the stage requires at least one parameter
  that has no sensible default, `Green` if all parameters have working defaults.
- At the end of `set_parameters()` — re-evaluate and call again based on the
  values that were just applied.

```cpp
MyStage::MyStage() {
    set_configuration_status(orc::ConfigurationStatus::Yellow);
}

bool MyStage::set_parameters(
    const std::map<std::string, orc::ParameterValue>& params) {
    auto it = params.find("output_path");
    const bool ready =
        it != params.end() &&
        std::holds_alternative<std::string>(it->second) &&
        !std::get<std::string>(it->second).empty();

    set_configuration_status(ready ? orc::ConfigurationStatus::Green
                                   : orc::ConfigurationStatus::Yellow);
    return true;
}
```

Read the current value with `get_configuration_status()` if needed. The default
(when `set_configuration_status()` is never called) is `Green`.

### Host services

The host passes an `OrcPluginServices` table as the first argument to
`orc_register_stage_plugin()`. Store it with `orc::plugin::set_services()`
before registering any stage. The table provides:

- `log` — pre-formatted message logging routed to the host logger. Use the
  `ORC_PLUGIN_LOG_TRACE` / `DEBUG` / `INFO` / `WARN` / `ERROR` / `CRITICAL`
  macros (from `<orc/plugin/orc_plugin_services_helpers.h>`) rather than
  calling the function pointer directly. Logging does **not** go through
  `IStageServices`.
- `render_colour_preview` — converts a decoded `ColourFrameCarrier` to a
  display-ready `PreviewImage` for preview-capable stages.
- `stage_services` — optional pointer to the consolidated `IStageServices`
  interface; may be `nullptr` when the capability is unavailable. Retrieve it
  with `orc::plugin::get_stage_services()` (no arguments), which returns
  `nullptr` if the services table is absent or predates the field.
- `observation_service` — optional pointer to the `IObservationService`
  interface (added in ABI 9). Retrieve it with
  `orc::plugin::get_observation_service()` (no arguments), which returns
  `nullptr` if the services table is absent or predates the field (any host on
  ABI 8 or earlier). See [Observation service](#observation-service-abi-9).

`IStageServices` currently exposes exactly three factory methods, used by sink
stages for buffered file output:

- `create_buffered_file_writer_uint8(size_t buffer_size)` — returns a
  `std::shared_ptr<IFileWriterUint8>`
- `create_buffered_file_writer_uint16(size_t buffer_size)` — returns a
  `std::shared_ptr<IFileWriterUint16>`
- `create_buffered_file_writer_int16(size_t buffer_size)` — returns a
  `std::shared_ptr<IFileWriterInt16>` (16-bit signed PCM output, e.g. WAV
  audio)

New `IStageServices` methods are appended after existing entries (append-only
convention), so plugins built against an older SDK keep working with a newer
host within the same version pair.

Progress reporting and artifact-delivery callbacks are **not** part of the
current services contract. If your stage needs a host capability that is
missing, request an SDK extension rather than working around it.

#### Observation service (ABI 9)

`IObservationService`
(`<orc/stage/observation/observation_service_interface.h>`) is a host-owned
service that runs the standard observers. The observer *implementations* live
once, in the host; a plugin selects one by **stable string id** instead of
linking the concrete observer classes. This mirrors `render_colour_preview`:
the capability crosses the boundary as a host-owned interface, not as object
code compiled into every plugin.

Retrieve it with `orc::plugin::get_observation_service()`, which returns
`nullptr` on any host that predates ABI 9. A plugin **must** null-check the
result and degrade gracefully (skip the observation, log a warning) when the
service is absent.

The interface exposes:

- `available_observers()` — returns one `ObserverInfo { id, version,
  provided_observations }` per observer the host offers, in a stable order.
- `create_observer(observer_id)` — returns an owning
  `std::unique_ptr<IObserverHandle>` for a **stateful** session, or `nullptr`
  for an unknown id. Use this when observations accumulate across frames (e.g.
  the closed-caption observer pairs successive fields). Drive it with
  `handle->process_frame(representation, frame_id, context)`.
- `run_observer(observer_id, representation, frame_id, context)` — a one-shot
  convenience wrapper that creates a throwaway handle, processes exactly one
  frame, and returns `false` for an unknown id (leaving `context` untouched).
  Do **not** use it where cross-frame state matters.

No method throws across the plugin boundary: an unknown id yields a null handle
or `false`, never an exception. Thread-safety is documented on each interface
method — in short, the service is safe to call concurrently, but a single
`IObserverHandle` must be driven from one thread at a time.

##### Migrating from the observer classes

The concrete observer classes under `<orc/stage/observation/*_observer.h>`
(`BiphaseObserver`, `WhiteSNRObserver`, …) were **deprecated in ABI 9** and are
**removed in ABI 10**: the headers have left the plugin-facing SDK and
`orc-sdk-support` no longer ships their object code. Replace direct construction
with a service call keyed by the id below:

| Removed class | Observer id | Former header (removed in ABI 10) |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| `BiphaseObserver` | `biphase` | `<orc/stage/observation/biphase_observer.h>` |
| `BlackPSNRObserver` | `black_psnr` | `<orc/stage/observation/black_psnr_observer.h>` |
| `BurstLevelObserver` | `burst_level` | `<orc/stage/observation/burst_level_observer.h>` |
| `ClosedCaptionObserver` | `closed_caption` | `<orc/stage/observation/closed_caption_observer.h>` |
| `ColourFramePhaseObserver` | `colour_frame_phase` | `<orc/stage/observation/colour_frame_phase_observer.h>` |
| `FieldQualityObserver` | `disc_quality` | `<orc/stage/observation/field_quality_observer.h>` |
| `FmCodeObserver` | `fm_code` | `<orc/stage/observation/fm_code_observer.h>` |
| `WhiteFlagObserver` | `white_flag` | `<orc/stage/observation/white_flag_observer.h>` |
| `WhiteSNRObserver` | `white_snr` | `<orc/stage/observation/white_snr_observer.h>` |

Before (linked observer class):

```cpp
#include <orc/stage/observation/closed_caption_observer.h>

orc::ClosedCaptionObserver observer_;  // persistent member, stateful
observer_.process_frame(representation, frame_id, context);
```

After (host service, id-selected):

```cpp
#include <orc/stage/observation/observation_service_interface.h>

// Once, when the stage is constructed:
orc::IObservationService* observation_service =
    orc::plugin::get_observation_service();
if (observation_service) {
  observer_ = observation_service->create_observer("closed_caption");
}

// Per frame (observer_ is a std::unique_ptr<orc::IObserverHandle> member):
if (observer_) {
  observer_->process_frame(representation, frame_id, context);
}
```

For a stateless one-off, skip the handle and call
`observation_service->run_observer("closed_caption", representation, frame_id,
context)`.

### Optional: Stage tools

If your stage provides an interactive tool (e.g., a custom editor or analysis
view), implement `StageToolProvider` and return a vector of `StageToolDescriptor`
from `get_stage_tools()`. The host discovers these descriptors through the
presenter layer and routes them to the GUI without any hardcoded stage-name
dispatch.

## Testing

Unit-test your stage implementation in isolation. Inject a mock `IStageServices`
rather than depending on a live host. The skeleton template includes example
Google Test suites and CMake test registration.

Recommended ctest labels for plugin test suites:

| Label | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| `unit` | All fast, isolated stage unit tests |
| `sources` | Source stage tests |
| `transforms` | Transform stage tests |
| `sinks` | Sink stage tests |

## Distribution

### GitHub release assets

Publish platform binaries as GitHub release assets using the naming convention:

```
orc-plugin_<stage-name>_<platform>[_abi<N>].<ext>
```

where `<platform>` is `linux`/`macos`/`windows`, `<ext>` is
`so`/`dylib`/`dll`, and the optional `_abi<N>` token records the host ABI the
binary was built against (e.g. `orc-plugin_my-stage_linux_abi8.so`). Examples:

```
orc-plugin_my-stage_linux.so            # legacy, untagged
orc-plugin_my-stage_linux_abi8.so       # ABI-tagged (recommended)
orc-plugin_my-stage_macos_abi8.dylib
orc-plugin_my-stage_windows_abi8.dll
```

Tagging lets a single release ship builds for several host ABI versions side
by side. When resolving a release the host prefers the asset tagged for its
own ABI (`_abi<host>`), then falls back to a legacy untagged name (validated
at load time), and only selects an asset tagged for a different ABI as a last
resort — reporting "needs a rebuild" before it ever downloads a build it
cannot load. Untagged names remain valid for backward compatibility.

The skeleton CI workflows produce and upload these artifacts automatically on
tagged releases.

### Registry entry

Users register your plugin by adding an entry to their plugin registry YAML:

```yaml
- plugin_id:          com.example.my-stage
  plugin_version:     "1.0.0"
  source_repo_url:    https://github.com/example-org/orc-plugin_my-stage
  artifact_source:    github_release_asset
  release_asset_url:  https://github.com/example-org/orc-plugin_my-stage/releases/download/v1.0.0/orc-plugin_my-stage_linux.so
  release_tag:        v1.0.0
  release_asset_name: orc-plugin_my-stage_linux.so   # platform-specific
  target_platform:    linux
  required_host_abi:  8
  enabled:            true
  trust_state:        untrusted
  license_spdx:       MIT
  sha256:             9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08
```

The host downloads and caches the binary automatically the first time it
starts with this entry present — but only once the entry is trusted;
entries with `trust_state: untrusted` are neither downloaded nor loaded.
Trust is a decision separate from adding or enabling: adding a plugin through
the GUI Plugin Manager (local file, URL, or from the curated index) prompts an
explicit trust-confirmation dialog, and toggling **Enabled** never grants
trust. Entries supplied any other way — such as the hand-written snippet above
— default to untrusted and must be trusted via the Plugin Manager's **Trusted**
column or `orc-cli plugins trust <id>` (the CLI `plugins add --trusted` flag
trusts at add time). Publish the artifact's SHA-256 digest
so users can record it in the optional `sha256` field: the host then
verifies the download (and every
cache hit) against it and quarantines mismatching files. Without a `sha256`
the plugin still loads, with a warning that its integrity was not verified.
Plugin binaries are not code-signed; see the "Distribution integrity"
section of
[plugin-architecture.md](plugin-architecture.md#distribution-integrity) for
exactly what is and is not verified.

### Curated index and discovery

To reach users without hand-written YAML, list your plugin in the curated
index ([`orc-plugin-registry/`](../../orc-plugin-registry/README.md)). Open a
pull request adding an entry with per-(platform, host ABI) artifacts, each
carrying a mandatory `sha256`; a maintainer's merge publishes it immediately.
Users then discover and install it without knowing your URL:

```console
$ orc-cli plugins search deinterlace     # find listed plugins
$ orc-cli plugins info com.example.my-stage
$ orc-cli plugins install com.example.my-stage   # recorded untrusted
$ orc-cli plugins trust com.example.my-stage     # confirm trust
```

The GUI exposes the same flow through **Plugin Manager → Browse Plugins…**.
Installing from the index records the entry with the index-declared `sha256`
and leaves it untrusted until the user confirms trust. Hosts resolve the
artifact matching their platform and ABI, so a user on an unsupported host is
told "no build for this host" instead of downloading an incompatible binary.

## Versioning and Compatibility Policy

### Binary compatibility model

The plugin boundary is a **C++ ABI**, not a C ABI. `std::shared_ptr`,
`std::string`, STL containers, exceptions, and virtual-function tables all
cross the host/plugin boundary. Matching version numbers are therefore
necessary but not sufficient: a plugin must be built with the same compiler
family, the same C++ standard library, and a compatible build configuration
as the host. On Windows this includes the CRT flavour — a Debug-CRT plugin
cannot be loaded by a Release-CRT host.

Since ABI v5 this requirement is enforced at load time: the descriptor's
`toolchain_tag` field (populated by the `ORC_SDK_TOOLCHAIN_TAG` macro, and
automatically by `ORC_STAGE_PLUGIN_DESCRIPTOR`) encodes the compiler family
and major version, the C++ standard library, and — on Windows — the CRT
flavour, e.g. `gcc14/libstdc++`, `clang17/libc++`,
`msvc19/msvc-stl/release-crt`. The host requires the plugin's tag to equal
its own tag exactly and rejects the plugin with a diagnostic naming both
tags otherwise. The policy is deliberately conservative, consistent with the
exact-match rule for the version numbers.

The host requires **exact equality** for both `host_abi_version` and
`plugin_api_version`; a mismatch in either causes the plugin to be rejected
with a logged diagnostic. The `services_size` field in `OrcPluginServices`
is an intra-version safety net only: it guards access to service-table
fields appended within the current ABI version. It is not a cross-version
compatibility mechanism.

### Version history

The table below is generated from `orc/sdk/abi_history.yaml` — the single
source of truth for the ABI/API version log. Do not edit it by hand; run
`tools/gen_abi_history_docs.sh` and splice the output between the markers. The
`AbiVersionDocsSync` CTest (label `sdk`) fails when this block is stale.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED ABI VERSION HISTORY (source: orc/sdk/abi_history.yaml; regenerate with tools/gen_abi_history_docs.sh) -->

| `host_abi_version` | `plugin_api_version` | Change |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | — | Initial internal release; `plugin_api_version` not yet in descriptor |
| 2 | 1 | `plugin_api_version` added to `StagePluginDescriptor`; public SDK headers published |
| 3 | 1 | `OrcPluginServices` table added; `orc_register_stage_plugin` now receives `const OrcPluginServices*` as its first parameter; plugins must use the services table for logging instead of resolving host symbols directly |
| 4 | 2 | Decode-Orc 2.0: `VideoFrameRepresentation` replaces `VideoFieldRepresentation` as the primary frame-data contract; `DAGStage::execute()` operates on frame-based artifacts; `DropoutRun` replaces `DropoutRegion`; `FieldID`/`FieldIDRange` removed — use `FrameID`/`FrameIDRange`. All plugins must be rebuilt against the v2.0 SDK |
| 5 | 2 | `StagePluginDescriptor` gains the appended `toolchain_tag` field (populate with `ORC_SDK_TOOLCHAIN_TAG`); the loader requires the plugin's tag to equal the host's exactly. Registration helpers (`ORC_STAGE_PLUGIN_DESCRIPTOR`, `ORC_DEFINE_STAGE_PLUGIN`) added in `<orc/abi/orc_plugin_registration.h>` |
| 6 | 2 | Multi-track audio: `VideoFrameRepresentation`'s single-track audio accessors (`audio_locked()`, `get_audio_sample_count(FrameID)`, `get_audio_samples(FrameID)`) are replaced by a track-indexed API — `audio_track_count()`, `get_audio_track_descriptor(track)`, per-track frame-locked accessors, and per-track free-running stream accessors (`get_audio_stream_pair_count` / `get_audio_stream_samples`). New contract header `<orc/stage/audio_track.h>`. The vtable layout change requires all plugins to be rebuilt |
| 7 | 2 | Channel-pair audio (SMPTE 272M-1994): the track-indexed audio API is replaced by the channel-pair API — `audio_channel_pair_count()`, `get_audio_channel_pair_descriptor(pair)`, and `get_audio_samples(pair, id)` returning 24-bit-in-int32 samples. All audio is 48 kHz frame-locked (synchronous); the free-running stream accessors are removed. Contract header `<orc/stage/audio_track.h>` is replaced by `<orc/stage/audio/audio_channel_pair.h>`. The vtable layout change requires all plugins to be rebuilt |
| 8 | 2 | `VideoFrameRepresentation` gains `prime_audio_decode()`: a hook that forces a deferred whole-stream audio decode (e.g. EFM audio) to run up front with progress reporting, forwarded down the wrapper chain so sinks can meter it on the progress dialog. The appended virtual changes the vtable layout, requiring all plugins to be rebuilt |
| 9 | 2 | `OrcPluginServices` gains the appended `observation_service` pointer (`IObservationService`, new contract header `<orc/stage/observation/observation_service_interface.h>`): a host-owned service that runs the standard observers by stable string id, reached via `plugin::get_observation_service()`. Guarded by `services_size`; older hosts leave it null. Appended field only — plugins need not be rebuilt to keep working against ABI 8 behaviour |
| 10 | 2 | The concrete observer classes (the nine `<orc/stage/observation/*_observer.h>` headers — `BiphaseObserver`, `WhiteSNRObserver`, …) and the `Observer` base (`<orc/stage/observation/observer.h>`) are removed from the plugin SDK: observers are now host-internal and reached exclusively through the `IObservationService` added in ABI 9, selected by stable string id. `orc-sdk-support` no longer ships observer object code, and the deprecated pre-tier observation include-path shims (`<orc/stage/observers/...>` and the flat `<orc/stage/observation_*.h>` paths) are removed. `observation_schema.h`, `observation_context*.h`, and `observation_service_interface.h` remain the contract. Source-breaking for any plugin still including the observer classes — migrate to `IObservationService::create_observer(id)` |

### ABI impact decision table

Use this table to decide whether a change forces a `host_abi_version` bump.
When in doubt, treat the change as ABI-breaking. The bump-procedure guard
(`tools/check_abi_bump.sh`, run in CI) references this table in its failure
message.

| Change | Bumps the host ABI? |
|--------|---------------------|
| Reorder, resize, or retype a `StagePluginDescriptor` field | **Yes** |
| Change an entrypoint signature or the `register_stage` callback contract | **Yes** |
| Add, remove, or reorder a virtual on a contract type crossing the boundary (e.g. `VideoFrameRepresentation`, `DAGStage`, an observer interface) | **Yes** |
| Change the layout of any type passed across the boundary by value or by reference | **Yes** |
| Change the meaning/encoding of an existing cross-boundary type without a layout change | **Yes** (semantic break) |
| **Append** a field to `OrcPluginServices` guarded by `services_size` | No |
| Append a new capability **interface** reached via an accessor (see below) | No |
| Change a `support`-tier header (`orc/support/…`: `lru_cache.h`, `logging.h`, helpers) | No — recompile at leisure |
| Change registration-template internals (`ORC_DEFINE_STAGE_PLUGIN`) without altering the descriptor layout | No |
| Edit comments, docs, or `instructions.md` | No |

#### Preferred additive patterns

Two mechanisms let the host and the stage contract grow **without** a bump —
prefer them over editing an existing layout:

- **`services_size` append-only growth.** New host services are appended to
  `OrcPluginServices`; a plugin checks `services->services_size` before reading
  a field its compiled ABI does not guarantee. This is the sanctioned way to
  add host capabilities.
- **Capability-accessor factoring.** To grow a churn-prone domain (audio has
  driven five of the last ABI bumps), add a **new interface reached through an
  accessor** rather than new virtuals on the one vtable every plugin depends
  on — e.g. `frame.audio()` returning an `IFrameAudio*` (header
  `orc/stage/audio/`). Adding a brand-new interface is additive and changes no
  existing vtable layout, whereas appending a virtual to
  `VideoFrameRepresentation` invalidates every plugin. Apply this
  opportunistically at the next planned `VideoFrameRepresentation` revision
  rather than as a standalone bump.

See also the compatibility-gating section of
[plugin-architecture.md](plugin-architecture.md#compatibility-gating).

### When the host increments a version

If `host_abi_version` increases, you must rebuild your plugin against the new
SDK. The host will refuse to load binaries built against an older ABI.

If `plugin_api_version` increases, your plugin must update its stage
implementation to match the new stage contract and recompile.

Neither increment is made without a corresponding Decode-Orc release and
migration notes.

## Repository Naming Convention

External plugin repository names should use the prefix `orc-plugin_`:

```
orc-plugin_<name>     e.g.  orc-plugin_skeleton
                            orc-plugin_example_stage
```

This convention applies to repositories hosted under the decode-orc
organisation and is recommended for all third-party plugin authors.
