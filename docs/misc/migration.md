# Migration

## Migrating from Decode-Orc 1.x to 2.0

Decode-Orc 2.0 introduces a new frame-based internal representation (CVBS_U10_4FSC). This is a **breaking change**. Project files from Decode-Orc 1.x are not compatible with 2.0 and will be rejected at load time with a clear error message.

**Project file migration**: There is no automated migration path. Projects must be recreated in Decode-Orc 2.0. This is necessary because the stage names, parameter names, and signal-level domain have all changed in ways that cannot be safely inferred from a 1.x project file.

**Renamed stages**: The following stages were renamed in v2.0. If you recreate a project, use the new stage IDs:

| Old stage ID (1.x) | New stage ID (2.0) | Notes |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| `pal_comp_source` | `tbc_source` | Unified stage; video system detected from metadata |
| `pal_yc_source` | `tbc_source` | |
| `ntsc_comp_source` | `tbc_source` | |
| `ntsc_yc_source` | `tbc_source` | |
| `pal_m_tbc_comp_source` | `tbc_source` | |
| `field_map` | `frame_map` | New parameters: `remove_duplicates`, `pad_gaps`, `pad_strategy` |

**Removed stages**: The following stage was removed in v2.0 with no replacement:

| Removed stage ID | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| `hackdac_sink` | Hardware-specific stage removed from the core distribution |

**Renamed dialogues**: The GUI dialogues have been renamed to use frame-based terminology:

| Old name (1.x) | New name (2.0) |
|----------------|----------------|
| Line-scope | Frame-scope |
| Field-timing | Frame-timing |

**New stages in v2.0**:

| Stage ID | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `cvbs_source` | Load CVBS captures in the CVBS file-format family |
| `cvbs_sink` | Write CVBS_U10_4FSC output to the CVBS file-format family |

**Signal level domain**: All internal signal levels in v2.0 are in the CVBS_U10_4FSC 10-bit domain (blanking = 256, white = 844 for PAL; blanking = 240, white = 800 for NTSC). The 16-bit IRE-based domain used in v1.x is gone. The `video_params` stage parameters for level overrides now use 10-bit values.

## Migration from legacy vhs-decode builds

## Legacy JSON metadata

The current version of Decode-Orc (and the ld-decode-tools Decode-Orc replaces) require TBC files with metadata in the current SQLite format (previously ld-decode used JSON rather than SQLite).  Although older JSON metadata decodes will be accepted after a warning, they lack some of the newer fields used by Decode-Orc and may cause the tools to emit warnings about missing parameters.

If you have old decodes the recommended course of action is to re-decode the capture with a current version of ld-decode or vhs-decode.  Do not rely on post-decoded files as preservation artifacts as the decoder functionality will vary over time and the post-decode artifact is not deterministic (TL;DR - re-decoding is preservation - keeping old TBC files is not).

## Separate Y/C sources

Legacy versions of vhs-decode produced TBC Y/C pairs with the format `<name>_chroma.tbc` and `<name>.tbc`.

In order to use these files with Decode-Orc you will need to simply rename them.  `<name>_chroma.tbc` should become `<name>.tbcc` and `<name>.tbc` should become `<name>.tbcy`.  This is used by Decode-Orc to distinguish composite and separate sources when using features such as "quick project".
