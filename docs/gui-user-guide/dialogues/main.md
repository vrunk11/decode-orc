# Main window

The Orc-GUI main window contains:

* A **menu bar** (File / View / Tools / Help)
* A **toolbar** with quick-access buttons for common actions
* A central **processing graph editor** where you build your pipeline using **stages** and **connections**
* A **status bar** that shows short messages about what the application is doing

## Toolbar

Directly beneath the menu bar is a toolbar with buttons for the most common actions. Each button mirrors a menu item, so the menus remain available as well.

| Button | Does the same as | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Arrange to grid | **View → Arrange DAG to Grid** | Tidies the graph into a left-to-right grid. |
| Show preview | **View → Show Preview** | Opens the Preview window, or brings it to the front if it is already open. Disabled until a project is loaded. |
| Theme | **Tools → Themes** | A single button that cycles the theme in the order **Auto → Light → Dark**. Its icon shows the current mode — a half-disc for Auto, a sun for Light, and a crescent moon for Dark — and stays in sync with the Tools → Themes submenu. |

You can hide or show the toolbar with **View → Show Toolbar**.

## Menu Bar

### File Menu

#### New Project…

Creates a new, empty project.

When you choose **File → New Project…**, Orc-GUI asks you to select a project type:

* NTSC Composite
* NTSC YC
* PAL Composite
* PAL YC
* PAL-M Composite
* PAL-M YC

You can also choose the project's amplitude display unit (IRE, millivolts, or 10-bit samples; the default is 10-bit samples), which is used by dialogs such as the Line Scope.

A new project starts with an empty graph (no stages are added automatically). You add stages yourself in the graph editor.

#### Quick Project…

Creates a ready-to-run starter project from an existing capture.

When you choose **File → Quick Project…**, Orc-GUI asks you to select a video file:

* `.tbc` (composite TBC)
* `.tbcc` / `.tbcy` (YC TBC; requires both files as a pair)
* `.composite` (composite CVBS)
* `.y` / `.c` (YC CVBS; requires both files as a pair)

Orc-GUI then looks for the associated metadata alongside the file:

* `<base>.tbc.db` for TBC captures (legacy `<base>.tbc.json` metadata is accepted with a warning)
* `<base>.meta` for CVBS captures

If the metadata file is missing, the quick project cannot be created.

What Quick Project sets up for you:

* Detects whether the capture is **PAL**, **NTSC**, or **PAL-M** from the metadata
* Adds the appropriate **source stage** for the detected system and input type
* Reads the **decoder** recorded in the metadata and builds the pipeline to match:

  * **ld-decode** sources get a **Dropout Correction** stage between the source and the **Video Sink** (`source → dropout correction → video sink`). When the source has an EFM sidecar, an **EFM Decoder Sink** is also added and fed from the Dropout Correction stage's output.
  * **All other** sources (for example vhs-decode) are connected straight from the source stage to the **Video Sink** stage. Captures with only legacy JSON (`.tbc.json`) metadata carry no reliable decoder identity and are always treated as non-ld-decode.
* Adds a **Video Sink** stage (FFmpeg output mode by default)
* If found, automatically attaches optional files next to the capture:

  * `<base>.pcm`
  * `<base>.efm`

After creating a quick project, you should usually:

* Open **Stage Parameters** on the Video Sink stage to set the output path and mode, or use its **FFmpeg Preset Config** stage tool to apply an export preset
* Use **File → Save Project As…** to save the new project (quick projects start “unsaved”)

#### Open Project…

Opens an existing `.orcprj` project file.

#### Save Project

Saves the current project.

If the project has never been saved before, Orc-GUI will prompt you to use **Save Project As…**.

#### Save Project As…

Saves the current project under a new filename.

#### Edit Project…

Edits project-level details (such as name/description). This is enabled only when a project is loaded.

#### Quit

Exits the application.

---

### View Menu

#### Show Preview

Opens the Preview window (if a project is loaded), or brings it to the front if it is already open. This is where you can view decoded output for the currently selected stage.

#### Show Preview on Selection

A toggle.

When enabled, Orc-GUI automatically shows the Preview window when you select a stage in the graph editor.

#### Arrange DAG to Grid

Automatically lays out the graph in a tidy left-to-right grid based on stage order.

Use this when your graph becomes messy after adding or moving stages.

#### Show Toolbar

A toggle that hides or shows the toolbar beneath the menu bar.

---

### Tools Menu

#### Plugin Manager…

Opens the Plugin Manager, which lists the registered stage plugins (ID, path, version, source, and enabled state) and lets you add, remove, enable, and disable them.

* **Add Plugin…** registers a new plugin, either from a local plugin file or from a GitHub releases URL. Remote plugins are downloaded automatically. Adding a plugin is your consent for it to run: plugin binaries execute as native code, so only add plugins from sources you trust.
* **Remove** deletes the selected plugin from the registry (core plugins cannot be removed).
* The **Enabled** checkbox shows whether a plugin will load at the next application start. For entries that were placed in the registry outside of Orc-GUI (for example, a hand-edited registry file), the checkbox appears unchecked until you enable them — ticking it marks the plugin as trusted and enables it.

Registry changes take effect on the next application launch; the dialog offers a restart when you close it after making changes.

#### Themes

Chooses the user-interface theme, applied immediately:

* **Auto** follows the operating system's light/dark setting and tracks changes to it while the application is running.
* **Dark** and **Light** force the respective theme regardless of the OS setting.

The choice overrides the `--theme` command-line option and is remembered between runs. The same modes can be cycled quickly from the theme button on the [toolbar](#toolbar).

### Help Menu

#### User Guide…

Opens this user guide.

#### About Orc GUI…

Shows version/about information.

## Graph Editor Basics

The graph editor is the central workspace where you build your processing pipeline using:

* **Stages** (boxes)
* **Connections** (lines between stage ports)

### Adding Stages

To add a stage:

* Right-click on empty space in the graph editor
* Choose **Add Stage**
* Pick a stage from one of the categories:

  * Source
  * Transform
  * Sink (Core)
  * Sink (Analysis)
  * Sink (3rd party)

Orc-GUI filters the available stages to match your project’s video system (PAL/NTSC/PAL-M). For source stages it also filters by input type (Composite vs YC).

The new stage is placed where you clicked.

### Creating Connections

To connect stages:

* Drag from an output port on one stage to a compatible input port on another stage

Connections represent the flow of data through your pipeline.

### Selecting Stages and Connections

* Click a stage to select it
* Click a connection line to select the connection

To select multiple items, use standard multi-select gestures (depending on platform):

* Hold **Shift** or **Ctrl/Cmd** while clicking additional stages
* Drag a selection rectangle on empty space to select a group

### Moving Stages

* Click and drag a stage to reposition it
* With multiple stages selected, dragging one typically moves the selection together

If the layout becomes hard to read, use **View → Arrange DAG to Grid**.

### Renaming a Stage

* Right-click a stage
* Choose **Rename Stage…**

This changes the label shown on the stage.

### Editing Stage Parameters

* Right-click a stage
* Choose **Edit Parameters…**

Use this to set file paths, decoding options, thresholds, output settings, and other stage-specific behaviour.

### Running Stage Tools

Some stages offer interactive tools such as analysis, visualisation, and configuration helpers (e.g. the Disc Mapper, Dropout Editor, or FFmpeg Preset Config).

To access them:

* Right-click a stage
* Open **Stage Tools**
* Choose an available tool

If no tools apply to the selected stage, the menu will show that none are available.

### Triggering a Stage

Sink stages are executed by triggering them.

* Right-click a stage
* Choose **Trigger Stage** (if enabled)

If an action is unavailable, it is disabled and may show a tooltip explaining why.

### Stage Help

Every stage documents itself.

* Right-click a stage
* Choose **Help…**

This opens the stage's built-in documentation (purpose, parameters, tools, and status-indicator meanings).

---

## Zooming and View Navigation

### Zoom In/Out

* Use the mouse wheel over the graph editor to zoom

Zoom is intentionally limited (approximately **70% to 100%**) to keep stage rendering readable.

### Panning

Panning behaviour depends on platform and the underlying graph widget.

Common gestures include:

* Dragging the background with the middle mouse button
* Trackpad pan gestures

---

## Deleting Stages and Connections

### Deleting Connections

To delete a connection:

* Select the connection line
* Press **Delete**

### Deleting Stages

To delete a stage:

* Select the stage
* Press **Delete**

Important behaviour:

* Orc-GUI blocks deletion of stages that still have connections
* If you try, you will be prompted to disconnect all connections first

Alternative:

* Right-click a stage and choose **Delete Stage** (only enabled when the stage can be removed)
