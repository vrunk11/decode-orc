# DecodeOrcPluginSDKConfig.cmake
#
# CMake package configuration for the decode-orc Plugin SDK.
# Installed as lib/cmake/decode-orc-plugin-sdk/decode-orc-plugin-sdkConfig.cmake
# (the name find_package(decode-orc-plugin-sdk) resolves on case-sensitive
# filesystems); the repository copy keeps this descriptive filename.
#
# After find_package(decode-orc-plugin-sdk REQUIRED), the following are
# available:
#
#   orc::plugin-sdk   — INTERFACE imported target. Link your plugin against
#                       this target to get the SDK include directories
#                       (<orc/abi/...>, <orc/stage/...>, <orc/support/...>),
#                       spdlog/fmt, and the orc::orc-sdk-support static library
#                       (support-tier helper symbols). No host link required.
#
#   orc_add_stage_plugin()  — CMake helper macro (from DecodeOrcPluginSDKHelpers.cmake)
#                             for creating properly configured plugin targets.
#
# Example (external plugin CMakeLists.txt):
#
#   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
#   project(my-orc-plugin CXX)
#
#   find_package(decode-orc-plugin-sdk REQUIRED)
#
#   orc_add_stage_plugin(
#       my-stage-plugin
#       OUTPUT_NAME  my-stage-plugin
#       PLUGIN_VERSION "1.0.0"
#       SOURCES plugin.cpp my_stage.cpp
#   )

# Dependencies referenced by the exported targets' link interfaces:
#   orc::plugin-sdk      → orc::orc-sdk-support → spdlog, fmt
#   orc::orc-sdk-support → spdlog, fmt (SDK logging surface only)
# The host libraries (orc-core, orc-common) are no longer in the export set, so
# their heavy transitive dependencies (SQLite3, yaml-cpp, PNG, FFmpeg) are NOT
# required to configure a plugin against the installed SDK — spdlog and fmt are
# the only packages that must resolve before the Targets file is included.
